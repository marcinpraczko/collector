* Sphinx-Doc in Docker

** [5/7] [71%] Goal 01

- [X] Build Docker via Dockerfile

This was done - with docker-compose

Req:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
alias docker-compose=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose
#+END_SRC

- [X] Build with Docker-compose - Works
- [-] [2/3] Build with Makefile

  From some reason is not working - not sure why

  - [X] docker-compose build
  - [X] docker-compose up
  - [ ] docker-compose down

- [ ] Add sphinx-doc-rtd CSS - based on Today learning
- [X] Create simple Sphinx-Doc page

This is done - initial page

- [X] Remove hardcoded path in docs - repace it with ENV
- [X] Adjust docs / Docker file to run nginx (after build) - copy artifact
- [X] Deploy doc image to local minikube
- [X] Add to Makefile apply kubectl config
