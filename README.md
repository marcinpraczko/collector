Main workspace for most things which I am working with.

## Apps/Sphinx-doc

- [ ] Migrate this initial doc to proper folder

This aims to have docker image with Sphinx-doc tool and all helpful configuration.

There is `Makefile` in `apps/sphinx-doc` which so far builds proper docker images and uploading them
to local instance of minikube.

```bash
# Simple run
cd apps/sphinx-doc
make
```
